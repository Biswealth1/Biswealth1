## About Me
I hold a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** from Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology.  
I am also a student at **ALX Holberton School of Software Engineering**, where I collaborate on projects and build practical software development skills.  

I am a **Full-Stack Developer** and I enjoy coding a lot.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy:

- Learning new technologies  
- Building projects  
- Connecting with fellow developers  
- Watching tech videos and tutorials
